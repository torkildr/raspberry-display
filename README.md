RaspberryPi Wall mounted display
================================

This project is a "rehash" of the project written for the [Arduino UNO] [2].

Simply put, this will enable you (at least when finished) to controll the [Sure
P4 32x8] [3] display, and probably any other display using the *ht1632*
controller.
