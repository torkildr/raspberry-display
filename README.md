RaspberryPi Wall mounted display
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/torkildr/raspberry-display.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/torkildr/raspberry-display)

This project is a restart of the project written for the [Arduino UNO](https://github.com/torkildr/display)

Simply put, this will enable you (at least when finished) to controll the Sure P4 32x8 display,
and probably any other display using the *ht1632* controller.

Much of the ht1632 driver is adapted from [this repo](https://github.com/DerBer/ht1632clib).
